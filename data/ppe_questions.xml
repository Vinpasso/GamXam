        <question type="extended-answer" id="0">
            <body>What are some hardware/software reasons that running a program on identical hardware can lead to
                different results? What is the consequence?
            </body>
            <answers>
                <answer>
                    <body>Hardware: Same chip can vary under different conditions (such as temperature/thermal
                        throttling). A different chip of the same model can vary due to production differences in the
                        same conditions.
                        <p/>
                        Software: Any resources that are shared (cpu, network, etc.) can be contended, OS-Scheduling and
                        energy-saving features, etc.
                        <p/>
                        Consequence: Don't expect same performance between any 2 different runs, treat runs as a
                        stochastic experiment. Repeat it as many times as necessary.

                    <body>
                        Work with data stochastically
                        <p/>
                        Conduct multiple experiments
                        <p/>
                        Measure variance/confidence interval
                        <p/>
                        Try to control as much of the environment as possible
                        <p/>
                        Ensure there is a good spread over uncontrollable environment influences (measure on different
                        days, etc.)
                        <p/>
                        Be skeptical about results, look for unexpected changes in the environment.
