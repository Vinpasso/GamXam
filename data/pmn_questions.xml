                <answer>
                    <body>When two nodes that are invisible to each other communicate with a third node, their
                        transmissions interfere, as they can not sense the carrier. Handshaking using RTS/CTS (Request
                        to Send/Clear to Send) is implemented in conjunction with the CSMA/CA to overcome this problem.

            <answers>
                <answer>
                    <body>When a node is transmitting to another node and a third node wants to transmit to a fourth
                        one, the third node may falsely believe that it can not do so because it would cause
                        interference. In reality the second node might be outside of transmission range of node three
                        and the fourth node out of transmission range of node one. RTS/CTS messages may be used to
                        overcome this problem under certain circumstances.
