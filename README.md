# GamXam
Flashcard system for studying.

Go to [GamXam Github Page](https://vinpasso.github.io/GamXam/html/index.html) for the online version, use npm for the desktop version. Load the question catalogue from Github

The current question catalogue is [ppe_questions.xml](https://github.com/Vinpasso/GamXam/blob/master/data/ppe_questions.xml). The schema can be found in [questions.xsd](https://github.com/Vinpasso/GamXam/blob/master/data/questions.xsd).
Recommended way of editing the question catalogue is with an IDE that supports autocompletion in XML Documents (such as IntelliJ).
